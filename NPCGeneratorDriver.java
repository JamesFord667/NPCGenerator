 * Purpose of Program: This program is designed to generate a random race and name for tabletop RPGs. 
 * 						Currently, it will generate a race and name based on a percentage. This way more
 * 						prevalent races will come up more often than races that are considered more rare
 * 						in the world. 
 * 						In the future, a way to adjust the odds of a particular race occurring should be 
 * 						able to be adjusted by the user. 
 *  
 * Purpose of class: This class runs the NPC Generator program.
